-Attempted to fix the Array Adding System.
-Found a problem With The Map Array Adding System. if we use it that way then when
 we update it people would lose the maps and their spawns since we updated the Arrays. 
 We are going to have to make a sepreate file for the Arenas or put them into the Config.
